# Installation
Make sure you have:

- "/var/files" folder available for writing/reading to a web user ("www-data" usually)

1. Clone bashupload repo to a folder.
1. Setup webserver and point it to web/index.php (or just use Nginx virtual host config from "setup" folder).
1. Tune config.php to your requirements. You can optionally copy config.php to config.local.php and make changes there (the file is untracked in GIT).
1. Add "php tasks/clean.php" to be executed every hour using cron:
```
0 *     * * *     root   php /path/to/bashupload/tasks/clean.php
```

# Configuration
- You can change config.php (or untracked config.local.php file) to tune expiration and download limits to your needs.
- Change post_max_size and upload_max_filesize in php.ini to meet your needs on maximum upload file size.
- If you use Nginx, don't forget to update "client_max_body_size" param as well.
